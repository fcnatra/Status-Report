Status Report Support
=====================

This repository contains supporting files that can help you create a status report. It is based on, copied from, and/or a version of the work from [Samman Technical Coaching](https://github.com/sammancoaching/daily-status/).

The idea is that a tech leader can get help from a **GenAI** tool to create a report suitable for sharing with the team and their managers. The email will include a summary of what has happened, along with an image to represent it.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Download a copy of the file `Status report guidelines for GenAI.txt`.
2. Update the company name, website URL, and role fields in the first part of the prompt.
3. Create a new chat in a **GenAI** tool, upload the guidelines file, and prompt the tool to go through the process with you. For example, you could use this prompt:
   > Create a daily status report using the attached guidelines
4. It could be helpful to use a speech-to-text interface so you can answer the **GenAI's** questions verbally instead of typing them.
5. If the tool can generate an image, it will do it for you. Otherwise, it will produce an image prompt for you to use with an appropriate service.

## Where to Go for More Information

This first version is a relatively new addition to the **Samman** method. They hope to write more about it soon. In the meantime, please sign up for their [newsletter](https://sammancoaching.org/newsletter.html).
