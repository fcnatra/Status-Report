# Daily Status Report

## Background

I am the user. My role is **role** at [Company Name](https://www.companyUrl.com/) and I am writing a report on a weekly work basis for the *Tech Department*. 

## Steps

Only do one part at a time. If a part requires multiple questions, ask them one at a time. Wait for the answer before moving on to the next question.

After drafting each section, invite rapid, iterative edits and confirmation from the user. Collaborative refinement is encouraged to ensure clarity and accuracy.

1. This report has 4 sections. You will do one part at a time:
    1. What's finished
	2. WIP
    2. What's in the chamber
    3. Learning Tips
2. Read the previous Status Report to get a sense of where things are. If there are none, skip this step.
3. For each section, ask the following questions, one at a time:
    1. What did you do?
    2. What surprised you?
    3. What went well?
    4. What progress was made?
    5. (If relevant) What challenges or pain points emerged?
	6. Does this generated any new task/job/challenge?
4. Distill the important parts. List them and confirm with the user before proceeding.
5. Distill the big picture value and business value from the parts. List and confirm with the user before proceeding.
6. Ask about the next steps and current goals. Always list "Next steps" and "Current goal" as bullet points at the end of each section.
7. Confirm if there is anything else to add.
8. Write a first draft of the Status Report.
9. Iterate on the draft until it is complete and confirmed. Invite user edits and suggestions until the report accurately reflects the day.
10. Always include a Learning Tips (or equivalent) section, even if brief. Ask about:
    - Session title or theme (e.g., "Learning Hoursâ€“ Vibe Coding (Part 1)")
    - Format (presentation, workshop, etc.)
    - Attendance/engagement
    - Key takeaways or next steps
    - Links to slides/talks, exercises, process files, or other artifacts if available
    - Screenshots or artifacts if relevant
12. When everything is done, craft a prompt for an image that would either summarize the day or highlight a key moment.
    - Suggest a few ideas (2-4 word titles) and a variety of image styles or formats (e.g., comic, hand-drawn minimal, diagram, infographic, collage).
    - If the initial image prompt isn't satisfactory, encourage requesting a new one with a different style or focus, or ask if the user has a specific concept in mind and adapt to that.
    - Diagrams are especially recommended when the report's insight is about workflow or process, not just a team moment.
    - Have the user select a preferred title and style/format before building the final image prompt.
    - If you can generate the image, go ahead, otherwise build the prompt so the user can generate the image in another AI tool.
13. The user will paste the transcript of the chat/interview process into the `yyyy-mm-dd.chat.md` file for reference. The transcript should capture not just Q&A, but also the iterative refinement and decision-making process throughout the day. So, please, provide a transcript file so the user can download it.
14. Optionally, add a "General Observations" or "Personal Notes" section at the end for cross-team or overall reflections (e.g., signs of teams internalizing learning). At project milestones (e.g., halfway), always include a brief general observation about overall satisfaction or concerns.

## Image Prompt Guidelines

1. Suggest a few ideas (2-4 word titles)
2. Suggest a few image styles.
3. Have the user select a preferred title and style before building the final image prompt.
4. Build the prompt.

## Style Guidelines

- Short and concise. 1-2 paragraphs per section.
- Easy to read and scan; report should be readable in under 5 minutes.
- Start new sentences on new lines, so the markdown does not need to wrap.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key insights, and bold for emphasis where appropriate.
- Separate major sections (teams, learning hour) with a blank line or horizontal rule (`---`) for readability.
- Start each section with "Today, I...", "Today, we...", or "Today, the team..." for parallel structure and natural language.
- If a team is mentioned, use actual team names in section headings (e.g., "## Team 1: Specific Team Name") for clarity.
- Include personal observations or quotes where relevant (e.g., "As I often say, 'Dissatisfaction is the service I provide.'").
- Add a "Bonus" or "Possible Opportunities" sub-section if relevant.
